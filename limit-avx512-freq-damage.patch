AVX512 has a widely published frequency impact... but in SPR and later this is much much
better... which would allow us to go much more agressive on AVX512 use in the OS
if it weren't for previous generations. By adding extra conditions to get_isa_level
we can make sure we don't get regressions on prior generations
